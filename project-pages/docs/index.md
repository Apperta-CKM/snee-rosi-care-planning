# Apperta MSK / Orthopaedic pathways

## Introduction

This project aims to build and publish a number of openEHR archetypes and templates, relating to the kind of clinical and patient-recorded information associated with a typical MSK/ Orthopaedic pathway/journey, and used for example in the [openOutcomes application].

The initial focus will be on PROMS (Patient Reported Outcome Measures), with the ultimate aim of having these re-published by openEHR International.

## openEHR archetypes and templates

For those not familiar with openEHR, this [short introductory video](https://youtu.be/uWBAeu464rM?t=62) may be helpful - watch until about 15m 20s.

Archetypes are definitions of components of information to be stored in a healthcare record or application. For example how to record a blood pressure, or a diagnosis, or a specific PROM like EQ-5D.

This short video explains one the archetypes under review - the MSK-HQ score.

###
The non-profit openEHR community works directly with clinicians and other health and care professionals to define and then freely share the archetypes and templates, using tools that non-engineers can use to create and review the archetypes.

## Reviewing archetypes

Building archetypes is normally done by clinical informatics but they need to be reviewed by specialists in the subject, in this case people with a knowledge of MSK and Orthopaedics pathways.

We use a special tool called 'Clinical Knowledge Manager' for this purpose, inviting people to review the archetype on-line.

The CKM tool we are initially using for this project is hosted by Apperta on behalf of openEHR UK, specifically for UK-based projects.

You will receive a specific email invitation to participate as a reviewer. There is absolutely no cost and we promise not to hassle you with too many reminders - you can opt out at any point.

The process is straightforward but you might find it helpful to watch this [Video walk-through](https://vimeo.com/842865092?share=copy) of what is involved.

This [Reviewing archetypes](./CKM-001-%20Reviewing-an-Archetype-on-CKM.md) page might also be helpful.

When reviewing archetypes, remember that these are not 'forms' as such - they are definitions of the information that sits beneath, so don't worry about the exact appearance.
